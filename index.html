    <h2>Algorithms:</h2>
    <p>
      Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that
      takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or
      set of values, as output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational
      steps that transform the input into the output. We can also view an
      algorithm as a tool for solving a well-specified computa- tional problem.
      The statement of the problem specifies in general terms the desired
      input/output relationship. The algorithm describes a specific
      computational proce- dure for achieving that input/output relationship.
      For example, we might need to sort a sequence of numbers into
      nondecreasing order. This problem arises frequently in practice and
      provides fertile ground for introducing many standard design techniques
      and analysis tools.

    <h2>Types of Algorithms:</h2>
    <p>
      Sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, insertion sort, and many more. These
      algorithms are used to sort the data in a particular format.
    </p>
    <p>
      Searching algorithms: Linear search, binary search, etc. These algorithms
      are used in finding a value or record that the user demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graph Algorithms: It is used to find solutions to problems like finding
      the shortest path between cities, and real-life problems like traveling
      salesman problems.
    </p>
    <h2>Algorithm complexities:</h2>
    <p>
      Complexity in algorithms refers to the amount of resources (such as time
      or memory) required to solve a problem or perform a task. The most common
      measure of complexity is time complexity, which refers to the amount of
      time an algorithm takes to produce a result as a function of the size of
      the input. Memory complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an
      algorithm. Algorithm designers strive to develop algorithms with the
      lowest possible time and memory complexities, since this makes them more
      efficient and scalable. The complexity of an algorithm is a function
      describing the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of the amount of data
      the algorithm must process. Usually there are natural units for the domain
      and range of this function. An algorithm is analyzed using Time Complexity
      and Space Complexity. Writing an efficient algorithm help to consume the
      minimum amount of time for processing the logic
    </p>
    <h2>Data Structures:</h2>
    <p>
      A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used
      for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic
      and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every
      program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good
      knowledge about data structures.
