    <h2>Algorithms:</h2>
    <p>
      Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that
      takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or
      set of values, as output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational
      steps that transform the input into the output. We can also view an
      algorithm as a tool for solving a well-specified computa- tional problem.
      The statement of the problem specifies in general terms the desired
      input/output relationship. The algorithm describes a specific
      computational proce- dure for achieving that input/output relationship.
      For example, we might need to sort a sequence of numbers into
      nondecreasing order. This problem arises frequently in practice and
      provides fertile ground for introducing many standard design techniques
      and analysis tools.

    <h2>Data Structures:</h2>
    <p>
      A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used
      for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic
      and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every
      program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good
      knowledge about data structures.
