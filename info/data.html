      A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used
      for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic
      and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every
      program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good
      knowledge of data structures. Data structures are an integral part of
      computers used for the arrangement of data in memory. They are essential
      and responsible for organizing, processing, accessing, and storing data
      efficiently. But this is not all. Various types of data structures have
      their own characteristics, features, applications, advantages, and
      disadvantages. So how do you identify a data structure that is suitable
      for a particular task? What is meant by the term ‘Data Structure’? How
      many types of data structures are there and what are they used for?
      Classification of Data Structure: Linear data structure: Data structure in
      which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each
      element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called
      a linear data structure. Examples of linear data structures are array,
      stack, queue, linked list, etc. Static data structure: Static data
      structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in
      a static data structure. An example of this data structure is an array.
      Dynamic data structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed.
      It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered
      efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. Examples
      of this data structure are queue, stack, etc. Non-linear data structure:
      Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or
      linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data
      structure, we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only.
      Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs. Sorting
      algorithms: Bubble Sort, insertion sort, and many more. These algorithms
      are used to sort the data in a particular format.
