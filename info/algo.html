    <h2>Types of Algorithms:</h2>
    <script src="algo.js" defer></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="algo.css" />
    <p>
      Sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, insertion sort, and many more. These
      algorithms are used to sort the data in a particular format.
    </p>
    <p>
      Searching algorithms: Linear search, binary search, etc. These algorithms
      are used in finding a value or record that the user demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graph Algorithms: It is used to find solutions to problems like finding
      the shortest path between cities, and real-life problems like traveling
      salesman problems.

    <h2>Algorithm complexities:</h2>
    <p>
      Complexity in algorithms refers to the amount of resources (such as time
      or memory) required to solve a problem or perform a task. The most common
      measure of complexity is time complexity, which refers to the amount of
      time an algorithm takes to produce a result as a function of the size of
      the input. Memory complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an
      algorithm. Algorithm designers strive to develop algorithms with the
      lowest possible time and memory complexities, since this makes them more
      efficient and scalable. The complexity of an algorithm is a function
      describing the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of the amount of data
      the algorithm must process. Usually there are natural units for the domain
      and range of this function. An algorithm is analyzed using Time Complexity
      and Space Complexity. Writing an efficient algorithm help to consume the
      minimum amount of time for processing the logic
